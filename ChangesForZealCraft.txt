TempleCraft changes manually made by doodguy and not the converter:
-In lines 335 and 344 I added a return 0; because the compiler complained with a warning about the function needing to return a value.

-On line 439 in the U0 DrawSky function, the compiler warns that sunRadius is using a 64-bit reg variable. 
So I changed sunRadius from a U8 to a U64.
-Line 404, the compiler complains that the variable F64 time is unused. So I removed it. It is indeed unused because
there is some commented out code where time actually gets used for the day-night cycles but the original
author didn't get around to finishing it or something. The original function definition will be left as a comment.

-In the WorldInteract function, on line 719 the compiler warns about the variable id using a 64-bit variable.
This was changed to U64 id

-In the DrawIt function, on line 764, the Seed was seeded with Seed(god.words[RandU64%god.num_words]);
This was changed to Seed(god.words[RandU64%god.word_count]); because the previous would result in an 
error since the GodExterns were renamed
-On lines 819 through 823, ms.pos.z, ms.pos.x, and ms.pos.y were changed to mouse.pos.z and mouse.pos.x, and mouse.pos.y
Similar changes were made for line 834 and 840
-ALSO for DrawIt I later saw that the compiler says that the variable CTask *task is unused. So I changed
the function definition to U0 DrawIt(CDC *dc). The original function name is left as a comment.

-Due to changes to DrawSky's function definition, on line 957, the first call to DrawSky, I change the call
from DrawSky(dc, 3.0) to DrawSky(dc);

-More ms to mouse shenanigans for line 1033 and 1035

-In the SaveWorld function, on line 1613 I changed ACAlloc(maxData) to SystemAlloc
-On line 1630 there was a warning about 64-bit reg variables so I changed it to U64

-On line 1766 in the TheLoop function I changed ScanMsg to MessageScan 
and also MSG_KEY_DOWN and so on were changed to MESSAGE_KEY_DOWN and so on
-This is also true for lines 1772, 1777, 1782, and 1824
-In line 1862 I changed Snd to Sound
-In line 1894 I changed SndRst to SoundReset

-In lines 1684 and 1685 I converted the variables sum and i to 64-bit values even though
the function name is "GetU8FromStringB16". If it breaks, too bad. Tom can fix it. 

-In line 1741 in the LoadWorld function I changed blockData from U8 to U64 because of 
another one of those warnings.

-In line 1954 in the MenuAbout function I commented out the return i

-In line 1998 and line 2035 in the StartupMenu function I changed StrCpy to StrCopy
-In line 2035 and 2036 I also changed god.num_word to god.word_count
-In line 2048 I changed StrCpy to StrCopy

-In line 2119 in main I changed WIG_USER_TASK_DFT to WIG_USER__TASK_DEFAULT
